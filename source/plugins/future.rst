Future plugins
==============

Plugins planned for future releases and non-core plugins are discussed in the `QIIME 2 Forum`_. If you have questions about the availability of QIIME 2 methods, actions, pipelines, or plugins, please post your questions there. If you are working on a plugin that is not part of the QIIME 2 core distribution, but you'd like to inform QIIME 2 users about it, you should post a topic to the `Community Plugins category`_ on the forum.

If you're looking for documentation on how to develop a plugin, see :doc:`this guide <developing>`.
