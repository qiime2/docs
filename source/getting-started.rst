Getting started
===============

This guide will walk you through the steps necessary to understand, install, and use QIIME 2 for your own microbiome analyses:

1. Familiarize yourself with the :doc:`core concepts <concepts>` of QIIME 2 before starting to use the system.

2. :doc:`Install QIIME 2 <install/index>`.

3. Work through the :doc:`tutorials <tutorials/index>` to learn how to use QIIME 2 to perform microbiome analyses. We recommend starting with the :doc:`grand overview <tutorials/overview>` and :doc:`Moving Pictures tutorial <tutorials/moving-pictures>`, followed by the :doc:`FMT study <tutorials/fmt>` and :doc:`Atacama Desert soils <tutorials/atacama-soils>` tutorials.

4. Try out other interfaces. QIIME 2 supports multiple user interfaces, and you've only been exposed to :doc:`q2cli <interfaces/q2cli>`, a command line interface, so far. If you are interested in using a different interface for your QIIME 2 analyses, explore the :doc:`interfaces <interfaces/index>` that are currently available. For example, check out the :doc:`QIIME 2 Studio <interfaces/q2studio>` if you are looking for a graphical user interface, and the :doc:`Artifact API <interfaces/artifact-api>` if you are wanting to use a Python 3 API optimized for the `Jupyter Notebook`_.
