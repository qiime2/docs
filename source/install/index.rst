Recommendations
---------------

The :doc:`native conda installation <native>` is generally the recommended
method of installation, but this isn't always available or a straight-forward
option for all cases. In general we recommend the following:

* `macOS`_ users

  - A :doc:`native conda installation <native>` usually works well
  - :doc:`Docker <virtual/docker>` and :doc:`VirtualBox <virtual/virtualbox>`
    are good backup options

* `Windows`_ users

  - On newer versions of Windows, performing a :doc:`native conda
    installation <native>` in the `Windows Subsystem for Linux`_ usually
    works well
  - :doc:`Docker <virtual/docker>` and :doc:`VirtualBox <virtual/virtualbox>`
    are good backup options

* Linux users

  - A :doc:`native conda installation <native>` usually works well
  - :doc:`Docker <virtual/docker>` and :doc:`VirtualBox <virtual/virtualbox>`
    are good backup options
