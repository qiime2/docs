Installing QIIME 2 using WSL
----------------------------

.. include:: ../../_old_docs_warning.rst

Please see the `official Microsoft guide`_ to install and set up the WSL. Once
you have installed and set up the WSL, install a Linux distribution (step 6 of
the WSL guide). We suggest the latest stable version of `Ubuntu`_.

Once you have set up the WSL, you can follow the
:doc:`native conda installation <../native>` guide, choosing the *Windows (via
WSL)* instructions to finish setting up QIIME 2.

Please check out the `QIIME 2 Forum`_ for Community Contributions related to
setting up and using the WSL.
