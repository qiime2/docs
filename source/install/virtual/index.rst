Installing QIIME 2 using a Virtual Machine
==========================================

.. include:: ../../_old_docs_warning.rst

*QIIME 2 Distribution* builds are available as Docker Images. See :ref:`distributions` for more details about the available distributions.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   docker
   wsl

.. note:: As of the QIIME 2 2022.8 release, we will no longer be releasing AWS or VirtualBox builds, due to the fact that our release of these builds restricts users to a specific operating system/cloud platform/etc. We feel that we are better serving our user community by providing cross-platform builds (e.g. Docker containers) and detailed instructions on how to work with them.
