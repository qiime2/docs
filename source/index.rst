QIIME 2 documentation
=====================

This site is the official source of information on QIIME™ 2, including installation instructions, tutorials, and other documentation. Visit http://qiime.org for information on QIIME™ 1.

.. note:: QIIME 2 is in its **alpha release phase**. Since it is alpha software, it is not necessarily stable or complete. Commands, functionality, interfaces, and documentation **will change** as the software reaches beta status. QIIME 1 is still the recommended platform for microbiome analyses as it is relatively stable, feature-complete, and supports high-performance computing environments. QIIME 1 will continue to be supported through the end of 2017 to allow QIIME 2 to stabilize and users to transition to using this new software. Please give QIIME 2 a try and let us know how it can be improved by creating an issue on our `issue tracker`_.
