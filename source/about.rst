What is QIIME 2?
================

QIIME 2 is a powerful, extensible, and decentralized microbiome analysis package with a focus on data and analysis transparency. QIIME 2 enables researchers to start an analysis with raw DNA sequence data and finish with publication-quality figures and statistical results.

Key features:

* Integrated and automatic tracking of data provenance
* Semantic type system
* Plugin system for extending microbiome analysis functionality
* Support for multiple types of user interfaces (e.g. API, command line, graphical)

QIIME 2 is a complete redesign and rewrite of the `QIIME 1`_ microbiome analysis pipeline. QIIME 2 will address many of the limitations of QIIME 1, while retaining the features that makes QIIME 1 a powerful and widely-used analysis pipeline.

QIIME 2 currently supports an initial end-to-end microbiome analysis pipeline. New functionality will regularly become available through QIIME 2 plugins. You can view a list of plugins that are currently available on the QIIME 2 :doc:`plugin availability <plugins/available/index>` page. The :doc:`future plugins <plugins/future>` page lists plugins that are being developed.
