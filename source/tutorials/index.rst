Tutorials
=========

.. note:: The tutorials assume you have installed the QIIME 2 Core distribution using one of the procedures in the :doc:`install documents <../install/index>`. The tutorials make extensive use of the QIIME 2 command-line interface so reviewing the :doc:`q2cli docs <../interfaces/q2cli>` is recommended.
