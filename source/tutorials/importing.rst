Importing data
==============

.. note:: This tutorial assumes you have installed QIIME 2 using one of the procedures in the :doc:`install documents <../install/index>`.

In order to use QIIME 2, your input data must be stored in *QIIME 2 artifacts* (i.e. ``.qza`` files). This is what enables distributed and automatic provenance tracking, as well as semantic type validation and transformations between data formats (see the :doc:`core concepts <../concepts>` page for more details about QIIME 2 artifacts). This tutorial demonstrates how to import various data formats into QIIME 2 artifacts for use with QIIME 2.

.. note:: This tutorial does not describe all data formats that are currently supported in QIIME 2. It is a work-in-progress that describes some of the most commonly used data formats that are available. We are also actively working on supporting additional data formats. If you need to import data in a format that is not covered here, please post to the `QIIME 2 Forum`_ for help.

Importing will typically happen with your initial data (e.g. sequences obtained from a sequencing facility), but importing can be performed at any step in your analysis pipeline. For example, if a collaborator provides you with a ``.biom`` file, you can import it into a QIIME 2 artifact to perform "downstream" statistical analyses that operate on a feature table.

Importing can be accomplished using any of the QIIME 2 :doc:`interfaces <../interfaces/index>`. This tutorial will focus on using the QIIME 2 command-line interface (``q2cli``) to import data. Each section below briefly describes a data format, provides commands to download example data, and illustrates how to import the data into a QIIME 2 artifact.

You may want to begin by creating a directory to work in.

Sequence data with sequence quality information
-----------------------------------------------

"EMP protocol" multiplexed single-end fastq
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format description
******************

In the "Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) protocol" format for single-end reads, there are two ``fastq.gz`` files, one containing sequence reads and one containing the associated barcode reads, with the sequence data still multiplexed. The order of the records in the two ``fastq.gz`` files defines the association between a sequence read and its barcode read.

"EMP protocol" multiplexed paired-end fastq
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format description
******************

In the "Earth Microbiome Project (EMP) protocol" format for paired-end reads, there are three ``fastq.gz`` files, one containing forward sequence reads, one containing reverse sequence reads, and one containing the associated barcode reads, with the sequence data still multiplexed. The order of the records in the three ``fastq.gz`` files defines the association between the sequences reads and barcode reads.

"Fastq manifest" formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Format description
******************

In the fastq manifest formats, a manifest file maps sample identifiers to ``fastq.gz`` or ``fastq`` `absolute filepaths`_ that contain sequence and quality data for the sample, and indicates the direction of the reads in each ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` absolute filepath. The manifest file will generally be created by you, and it is designed to be a simple format that doesn't put restrictions on the naming of the demultiplexed ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files, since there is no broadly used naming convention for these files. There are no restrictions on the name of the manifest file.  

The manifest file is a comma-separated (i.e., ``.csv``) text file. The first field on each line is the sample identifier that should be used by QIIME, the second field is the absolute filepath, and the third field is the read direction. Lines beginning with ``#`` and blank lines are ignored. The first line in the file that does not begin with a ``#`` and is not blank must be the header line: ``sample-id,absolute-filepath,direction``. With the exception of the header line, the order of lines in this file is not important.

For single-end reads, there must be exactly one line per sample id corresponding to either the forward or reverse reads. For paired-end reads there must be exactly two lines per sample id, corresponding to the forward and the reverse reads. The direction field on each line can only contain the text ``forward`` or ``reverse``.

The ``fastq.gz`` absolute filepaths may contain environment variables (e.g., ``$HOME`` or ``$PWD``). The following example illustrates a simple fastq manifest file for paired-end read data for two samples.

::

  sample-id,absolute-filepath,direction
  # Lines starting with '#' are ignored and can be used to create
  # "comments" or even "comment out" entries
  sample-1,$PWD/some/filepath/sample1_R1.fastq.gz,forward
  sample-2,$PWD/some/filepath/sample2_R1.fastq.gz,forward
  sample-1,$PWD/some/filepath/sample1_R2.fastq.gz,reverse
  sample-2,$PWD/some/filepath/sample2_R2.fastq.gz,reverse

Just like with ``fastq.gz``, the absolute filepaths in the manifest for any ``fastq`` files must be accurate. The following example illustrates a simple fastq manifest file for ``fastq`` paired-end read data for one sample.

::

  sample-id,absolute-filepath,direction
  sample-1,$PWD/some/filepath/sample1_R1.fastq,forward
  sample-1,$PWD/some/filepath/sample1_R2.fastq,reverse

There are four variants of this format which are defined in the following sections.

SingleEndFastqManifestPhred33
`````````````````````````````
In this variant of the fastq manifest format, the read directions must all either be forward or reverse. This format assumes that the `PHRED offset`_ used for the positional quality scores in all of the ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files is 33.

SingleEndFastqManifestPhred64
`````````````````````````````

In this variant of the fastq manifest format, the read directions must all either be forward or reverse. This format assumes that the `PHRED offset`_ used for the positional quality scores in all of the ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files is 64. During import, QIIME 2 will convert the PHRED 64 encoded quality scores to PHRED 33 encoded quality scores. This conversion will be slow, but will only happen one time.

PairedEndFastqManifestPhred33
`````````````````````````````

In this variant of the fastq manifest format, there must be forward and reverse read ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files for each sample id. As a result, each sample id is represented twice in this file: once for its forward reads, and once for its reverse reads. This format assumes that the `PHRED offset`_ used for the positional quality scores in all of the ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files is 33.

PairedEndFastqManifestPhred64
`````````````````````````````

In this variant of the fastq manifest format, there must be forward and reverse read ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files for each sample id. As a result, each sample id is represented twice in this file: once for its forward reads, and once for its reverse reads. This format assumes that the `PHRED offset`_ used for the positional quality scores in all of the ``fastq.gz`` / ``fastq`` files is 64. During import, QIIME 2 will convert the PHRED 64 encoded quality scores to PHRED 33 encoded quality scores. This conversion will be slow, but will only happen one time.

Obtaining example data
**********************

Since importing data in these four formats is very similar, we'll only provide examples for two of the variants: ``SingleEndFastqManifestPhred33`` and ``PairedEndFastqManifestPhred64``.

Per-feature unaligned sequence data (i.e., representative sequences)

Unaligned sequence data is imported from a fasta formatted file containing DNA sequences that are not aligned (i.e., do not contain `-` or `.` characters). The sequences may contain degenerate nucleotide characters, such as ``N``, but some QIIME 2 actions may not support these characters.
