# Source for "old docs"

This is the source of the old QIIME 2 user documentation (primarily focused on the amplicon distribution).
The rendered version of these docs can still be found at https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.10, but we recommend referring to the new docs as this content is outdated.

For the new amplicon docs, see https://amplicon-docs.qiime2.org.

For the MOSHPIT (metagenome) docs, see https://moshpit.qiime2.org.

For other learning resources, see https://library.qiime2.org.
